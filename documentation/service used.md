Services and Tools Planned for Use
MLFlow:

Purpose: Experiment tracking, model versioning, and management.
Usage: Logging parameters, metrics, and models during training (train_models.py), and tracking experiments (training_pipeline.py).
AWS (Amazon Web Services):

Purpose: Cloud infrastructure and services.
Usage:
EC2: Hosting application components and potentially running Docker containers (Dockerfile).
S3: Storing datasets, model artifacts, and any other persistent data.
Elastic Beanstalk: Deploying and managing web applications (deploy_aws.sh).
CloudWatch: Monitoring and logging for applications and services.
SNS: Setting up alerts for monitoring (set_up_alerts.py).
Terraform:

Purpose: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
Usage: Defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure (main.tf), ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
GitHub Actions:

Purpose: CI/CD pipeline automation.
Usage: Running linting, tests, and deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk (ci_cd.yaml).
WhyLabs/whylogs:

Purpose: Model and data monitoring.
Usage: Integrating comprehensive monitoring (monitoring.py) and setting up alerts for model performance (set_up_alerts.py).
Prefect:

Purpose: Workflow orchestration.
Usage: Defining and running the training pipeline (training_pipeline.py), ensuring steps are executed in sequence and handling dependencies.
Docker:

Purpose: Containerization of application components.
Usage: Packaging the model deployment (Dockerfile) for consistency across different environments.
Overall Integration Strategy
Data Handling: Use Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing (split_data.py, training_pipeline.py).
Model Training: Utilize Scikit-learn for training and evaluation (train_models.py), with MLFlow for experiment tracking and model management.
Deployment: Dockerize the application (Dockerfile) for containerization and deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (deploy_aws.sh).
Monitoring: Implement WhyLabs/whylogs for comprehensive model and data monitoring (monitoring.py) and set up alerts for performance degradation (set_up_alerts.py).
Infrastructure Management: Use Terraform (main.tf) to define and provision AWS resources, ensuring infrastructure as code principles are followed.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement GitHub Actions (ci_cd.yaml) for automated testing, linting, and deployment to ensure code quality and reliability.
